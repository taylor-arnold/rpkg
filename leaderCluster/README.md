Hartigan's clustering leader algorithm provides
 a means for clustering points given a predetermined radius
 of a cluster. Unlike other clustering algorithms it does not
 require the user to specify the number of clusters. The package
 provides a fast implementation of this algorithm in two dimensions
 using either euclidian distance or the Haversine formula,
 which takes latitude and longitude as inputs.

# hdir: Package to Accompany Humanities Data in R (2e) 

This repository hosts the R package **hdir**, which contains helpful wrapper functions
for working with humanities data. The functions were designed to simplify the code in
our book *Humanities Data in R (2e)*, without masking too much of the important logic
for those learning the R language. The package can be installed from within R as follows:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("statsmaths/hdir")
```

For more information about the text, see [https://humanitiesdata.org](https://humanitiesdata.org).
The package is released into the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 license; please
copy and reuse any of the functions in our own work as you find useful.
